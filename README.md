Welcome to the React Playground, a branch-based learning approach to getting up and running with React.

## Instructions
To get started with this tutorial, clone this repo to your local box and checkout the branch entitled `step-one:just-the-basics`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsumnersmith/react-playground.git
cd react-playground
git checkout step-one:just-the-basics
```
For each of the additional step, follow the same pattern of checking out the next, appropriate branch.

## Steps
1. **Just the Basics** An introduction to the concept of React components (and JSX) and how to get a basic component rendered on a page. `git checkout step-one-just-the-basics`
2. **Props and State** Learning the idea of data and updating the UI with new data. `git checkout step-two-props-and-state`
3. **Multiple Components** How do multiple components interact with each other without implementing a state-management framework? `git checkout step-three-multiple-components`
4. **Choose Your Own Adventure** Using what we've learned so far, let's build one of two sample projects. `git checkout step-four-choose-your-own-adventure`
